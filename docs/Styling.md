Pseudositer looks for elements with particular classes to populate with index links and content.  If the element does not already exist on the page, Pseudositer will generate it.  If the element does already exist on the page, pseudositer will use the existing element.

An empty page with a pseudositer `div` will be generated with this arrangement:

    <div id="pseudositer">

      <div class="pseudositer-index-container">

        <!-- Index level 0 contains links to files and folders located in #/ -->
        <div class="pseudositer-index pseudositer-index-0">
          <a href="#/Blue/" class="pseudositer-link">Blue</a>
          <a href="#/Green/" class="pseudositer-link">Green</a>
          <a href="#/Red/" class="pseudositer-link-selected">Red</a> <!-- This link is selected -->

          <!-- Further links to files and folders in #/ go here... -->
        </div>

        <!-- Index level 1 contains links to files and folders located in #/Red/ -->
        <div class="pseudositer-index pseudositer-index-1">
          <a href="#/Red/First/" class="pseudositer-link">First</a>
          <a href="#/Red/Second/" class="pseudositer-link-selected">Second</a> <!-- This link is selected -->
          <a href="#/Red/Third/" class="pseudositer-link">Third</a>

          <!-- Further links to files and folders in #/Red/ go here... -->
        </div>

        <!-- Index level 2 contains links to files and folders located in #/Red/Second/ -->
        <div class="pseudositer-index pseudositer-index-2">
          <a href="#/Red/Second/file.html" class="pseudositer-link-selected">file</a> <!-- This link is selected -->
          <a href="#/Red/Second/image.jpg" class="pseudositer-link">image</a>

          <!-- Further links to files and folders in #/Red/Second/ go here... -->
        </div>

        <!-- If there were further index levels visible, they would be here. -->
      </div>

      <div class="pseudositer-content">
        <!-- Content of #/Red/Second/file.html goes here -->
      </div>

	  <div class="pseudositer-error">
        <!-- Error message goes here -->
      </div>

	  <div class="pseudositer-loading">
        <!-- Loading message goes here -->
      </div>
    </div>

Your stylesheets should utilize these CSS classes.
- - -
### .pseudositer-content

The element that holds all content.  There should be only one on the page.
- - -
### .pseudositer-index-container

The element that holds all generated index elements.  There should be only one on the page.  If you specify your own `.pseudositer-index-<N>` elements, they do not need to be in this class.
- - -
### .pseudositer-index

This class applies to all generated elements that hold links from an index page.
- - -
### .pseudositer-index-`<N>`

These elements hold the links from a certain level of index page, starting at `0`.  There should only be one element for each level on the page.

For example, `pseudositer-index-0` is the class of the index of your root directory.
- - -
### .pseudositer-error

These elements hold any error messages generated by pseudositer.  These include, but are not limited to, timeout and 404 messages.
- - -
### .pseudositer-loading

These elements will appear when pseudositer is loading new content or indices.
